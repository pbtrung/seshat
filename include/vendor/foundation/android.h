\brief Android system header

Safe inclusion of Android specific headers. Application glue entry and exit
functions.

The Android implementation of foundation library is built on the Android NDK
and requires the android_native_app_glue and cpu-features NDK libraries, which
will be automatically included into the foundation library sources. If you use
another build system these libraries must NOT be included in the build. */
