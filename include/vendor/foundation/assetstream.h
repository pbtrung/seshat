\brief Stream for Android application assets

Stream for reading Android application assets, only available on Android
platform. Asset streams are read only streams stored in the application package.
For more information check the Android developer portal at
http://developer.android.com/intl/ru/tools/projects/index.html#ApplicationModules

Streams are not inherently thread safe, synchronization in a multithread use
case must be done by caller. */
