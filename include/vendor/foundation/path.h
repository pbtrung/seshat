\brief Path utilities

Path utilities for unifying, merging, cleaning and extracting path parts.

All function expect the path to be of a well formed format using forward
slashes only, such as [protocol:[//]][drive:][/]path/to/some/file[.ext],
except for #path_clean. Use #path_clean to create well formed paths from unknown
formats

Query functions to get subpath or parts of a path does not modify input buffers,
but return const strings specifying given substring of the input buffer. */
