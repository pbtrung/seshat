\brief Pseudorandom number generator

Pseudorandom number generator. The generator is thread-safe and lock-free,
except for the thread init/shutdown sequences which will use a mutex to
synchronize threads. Memory allocated for thread-local state buffers will be
reused by new threads once an old thread has exited and released ownership of
such buffers.

All random functions generate values in ranges where low limit of the range is
included in the set of value, while the high limit is excluded. This is denoted
[low,high) in the documentation for each function, as per
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_31-11 notation. */
