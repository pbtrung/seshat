\brief Stream for memory buffer

Stream for memory buffer, both statically sized and dynamically reallocated
buffers. Streams are not inherently thread safe, synchronization in a
multithread use case must be done by caller.

Seeking in a buffer stream will not resize the storage buffer or change the
current stream size. To change stream size and allocate buffer space use
#stream_truncate. */

/*! Allocate a new stream for memory buffers from an (optionally) existing
buffer. The buffer can grow up to the given capacity. If adopt and grow flags
set it will grow to any required size reallocating memory. The stream should be
deallocated with a call to #stream_deallocate.
