\brief Mutex for thread synchronization and signalling.

Mutex for thread synchronization and signalling.

A mutex (mutually exclusive) provides the means to synchronize threads. A mutex
can only be locked by one thread at any given time, and another thread that
tries to acquire a lock will be suspended until the lock is released by the
first thread.

A mutex can also be used to signal a thread to wake up from a sleeping state.
The sleeper thread should use the wait method, and then the signal method
can be used to trigger the thread to wake up. Locks on the mutex can be used
to synchronize execution between multiple sleeper threads.

Foundation mutexes are reentrant, a thread can call lock multiple times from
the same thread without blocking. The same number of matching unlock calls
have to be done before mutex is actually unlocked for other threads to access.
