\brief Events posting and processing

Base system for event posting and processing.

Double-buffered event streams with a lock-free structure of many-writers,
single-reader and yield-spinning over an atomic operation while waiting for
other threads to finish writing or swap-for-read. No locks needed as only write
block indicator needs to be protected (which can be done with atomic
operations).

The expected contention for writing is low as the write is a quick operation and
number of events posted to the same stream from different threads is very low.

Current buffer used to writing events is swapped during the event_stream_process
call, allowing new events to be posted during the event process loop (which will
then be delivered and processed during the next event process loop).

Delayed events will not be delivered for processing until the delivery timestamp
has passed. Delivery is not guaranteed until next pass of
<code>event_stream_process</code> and <code>event_next</code> iteration.

Event posting is thread safe. Event processing is not thread safe and must be
contained to a single thread. */
