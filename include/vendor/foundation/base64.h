\brief Base64 encoding and decoding

Base64 encoding and decoding, using [A-Z][a-z][0-9][+/] as encoding characters.

/*! Encode data in base64. Source and destination buffers must NOT be equal,
encoding cannot be in-place as encoded base64 data occupies more memory space
than input data (3 input bytes generate 4 output bytes).

To encode entire source buffer, the destination buffer must be at least
1+(ceil(size/3)*4) bytes, including space for the terminating zero character. If
the destination buffer is not large enough, the function will encode as much of
source data that fits into the destination buffer, including a terminating zero
(i.e ((capacity-1)/4)*3 bytes of source data).

The destination buffer string will always be zero terminated.

\param source      Source data buffer
\param size        Size of source data buffer in bytes
\param destination Destination string buffer
\param capacity    Capacity of destination string buffer in bytes
\return            Number of bytes written to destination string including
terminating zero */

/*! Decode base64-encoded data. Any invalid characters, linebreaks and noise
will be silently discarded. Source and destination buffers can be equal, since
