\brief Main entry points

Main application entry points. The library implements the platform specific
entry points into the application (like <code>int main(...)</code> for normal
C library based applications) and handles the initial setup.

The foundation library then calls into these entry points to provide the
application with a unified single entry point for each application lifetime
event (initialize, run and finalize). */

foundation_initialize to initialize the foundation library, and return an error
code to indicate success or failure. If this method returns an error
initialization will abort and the program will terminate. \return 0 for success,
