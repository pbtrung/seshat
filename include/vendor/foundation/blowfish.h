\brief Blowfish encryption and decryption

Blowfish encryption and decryption. Blowfish is a symmetric block cipher with
variable length key. For more information, see
https://www.schneier.com/blowfish.html

The blowfish state is not inherently thread safe, synchronization in a
multithread use case must be done by caller. */
