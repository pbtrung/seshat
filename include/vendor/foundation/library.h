Dynamic library loader for platforms supporting this concept. */

/*! Load library. Where libraries are searched is system dependent. If the
same library was already previously loaded, a new reference to the same library
object will be returned, otherwise a new library object will be created and
referenced.

Use #library_unload to release a reference to a library object.

If the given name does not contain the platform specific dynamic library prefix
and extension, the function will also try loading the library with this prefix
and extension added. If the name contains a path, it should be on the standard
format as returned by #path_clean

On platforms where dynamic library loading is not supported a not implemented
error will be reported.
\param name Dynamic library name (or optional path)
\param length Length of name/path
\return Null if not found or error loading, library object reference if loaded
successfully */
