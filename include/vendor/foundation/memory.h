\brief Memory management

Memory allocation and deallocation. The actual implementation of
allocation/deallocation can be controlled with the memory system declaration
given to #foundation_initialize at startup.

Memory allocation/deallocation can be tracked with memory_set_tracker if the
build configuration #BUILD_ENABLE_MEMORY_TRACKER is set to 1. If not, all memory
tracker calls are statically removed at compile time.

Memory can be tracked by context, set as a hash value (usually a static string
hash) if the build configuration #BUILD_ENABLE_MEMORY_CONTEXT is set to 1. If
not, all memory context calls are statically removed and context 0 is used
everywhere. Memory contexts are stored per thread. */

/*! Allocate memory. Memory will be aligned to the given alingment unless
set to 0, which will cause alignment to be ignored. Memory hints can be given to
allow the memory system to make better choises of how to allocate the memory. If
context is 0, the currently set memory context scope is used (see
#memory_context, #memory_context_push and #memory_context_pop) \param context
